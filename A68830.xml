            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now becauſe in every family, there is as the Philoſopher hath very well obſerved, a threefold combination.<note place="margin">Pol. i. c. 3,</note> One betwixt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1779:4"/> the Husband and the Wife; a ſecond betwixt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and the Child; a third, and laſt, betwixt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and the Servant; that nothing may happen to be disjoynted, and out of frame in any, following the method of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul. Col.</hi> 3.18. We will preſcribe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections here for all; and firſt begin with the nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Bond, as being the firſt. For <hi>Adam</hi> was a husband before he was a father. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe from theſe the reſt receive impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as in a Watch, if the ſpring be out of frame, the wheeles can never goe, or if they move not one an other, the hammer cannot ſtrike, ſo where there is not a fit correſpondency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1779:4"/> man and wife, the reſt of the family cannot but miſcarry in their Motions. Againe it is a thing worthy to be obſerved, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in this yoke, the husband be the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of the twaine, the Apoſtle yet requireth the duty of the wife; and for this we may render a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the tender of ſubjection comes from us with more difficulty, than that of our affections. To love is thought a pleaſant and delightfull thing; but to be ſubject to an others will is uſually counted hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and detrected as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the love of the husband depends for the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1779:5"/> moſt part upon the due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the wife. For if ſhe vouchſafe him the one, he ſhall be barbarous and brutiſh, if he ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turne her the other: the wife is the perſon then, with whom we muſt begin. The duty whereunto ſhe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted, is ſubjection; The perſons to whom this duty is to be tendred, are their own husbands.

                  <p>Surely no; but he would take woman out of man, &amp; not out of earth, that the priority and dignity of man might thereby bee eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.

And this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is ſo neceſſary, that without it the world could not long ſubſiſt; yea nature herſelfe would ſuddenly be diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>Things ſublunary and terreſtriall are all ſubject to the power, and influence of celeſticall bodies, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1779:8"/> being in their owne nature defective and ignoble, they muſt from them receive their due perfection. It is the earths ſubjecting of her ſelfe unto the Sunne, which firſt begets her fruites, and brings them afterwards to full maturity.

                  <p>This ſubjection of the Wife unto her Husband conſiſteth principally in three things. The firſt is an internall Act of the heart; as when the Wife, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhee come of a nobler houſe, and have brought with her a

This humbling of the heart is the fountaine of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſubjection; And when it floweth not from hence, 'tis eyther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, or counterfeit. For the avoyding of this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have the wife to feare her husband.<note place="margin">Eph. 5.33.</note> Now this may bee expreſſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of waies.</p>

                  <p>It is a Proverbe amongſt the French; <hi>Bonne femme &amp; bon marriage ſe dit, non de qui l'eſt, mais duquel on ſe taiſt; The beſt women, and the beſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are thoſe, which are ſo ſilently carried at home, that the world hath no occaſion to talke of them abroad.</hi> To hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them up therefore a little the better to this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, we will propound ſome certaine motives by which they may bee ſtirred and incited hereunto; and afterwards ſhew them the inbred letts, and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which may withhold
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1779:19"/> them from it. The Motives are of divers kindes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is taken from the Inſtitution of GOD, himſelfe, which is not any way to bee controlled: And ſurely religious Obedience will never ſtand to diſcuſſe the Commandements of God, but doe them.

                  <p>A third is taken from her tranſgreſſion. It was ſhe that violated the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and afterwards allured her husband to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with her in the fault:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1779:20"/> tis but juſtice therfore, that from thenceforth the wife ſhould obey the husband, conſidering the husband did miſcarry by obeying the wife, and this is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which the Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth; <hi>I permit not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a woman to teach, but to keepe ſilence with all ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For <hi>Adam</hi> was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but the woman was deceived, and was in the tranſgreſſion. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                  <p>A fourth is deduced from the inconveniencie, which may follow upon the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods ordinance, by the deniall of this ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For as in nature upon the interruption of her due &amp; ordinary courſe, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, inundations, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and other ſuch like
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1779:21"/> fearefull and diſaſtrous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents doe happen; So in a family upon the ſtoppage of this duty, there aryſeth nothing but brawles, and contentions, which like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous thunder ſhake the very rafters, and threaten the whole houſe with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall diſſolution. Feare and jealouſie like an earthquake ſplit their boſomes, and diſunite their hearts, and their affections. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the many miſeries which proceed from hence occaſion many teares, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> as by a generall deluge, the ſweet content, which might be taken in one anothers love, is utterly waſht away. But this may ſuffice; I will therefore paſſe from the motives, which ſhould
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1779:21"/> allure them, and come to ſpeake of the lets and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, which may keepe them from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is a proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of her owne nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, beauty, riches, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the like; in regard whereof ſhe vilifies her husband, and thinkes him every way unworthy to have any rule or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over her, Of ſuch the heathen Satyriſt.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond is to teach, and inſtruct her according to his ability in all ſuch things as may conduce to the well-leading of this life, or the obtaining of a better.

                     <hi>Iſchiomar</hi> in <hi>Xenophon</hi> was wont to deſire the Gods firſt to enable him to teach that which is good, and then to give his wife the grace to learne it.

                  <p>The third is to provide for all her neceſſary uſes, allowing her that, which

                  <p>What ſhall we ſay then of ſuch, as in a riotous and desbauched courſe conſume the dowry, which their wives have brought, and then turne them out like <hi>Hagar;</hi> to ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Are they not like
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1779:47"/> thoſe, that take great paines for the getting of Nuts, but having eaten the kernell, they caſt away the ſhell? Againe, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe, that live upon their wives labour, and careleſly waſte, what they induſtriouſly doe gather? The Moone ſure borrowes not her light from the Sunne, but the Sunne from the Moone. The husband is clothed with the ſpoyles of his wife; an order as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, as prepoſterous. In a word, what ſhall we thinke of thoſe, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they have a ſufficient eſtate, are very ſparing of it towards their wives, not conſidering, that they are equally to ſhare with them in eyther fortune.

Let husbands therefore love their wives, <hi>and not bee bitter unto them.</hi> But for our better proceeding in this point, wee will conſider, Firſt, what this bitterneſſe is. Secondly, How it muſt be avoyded. Thirdly, and laſtly, the reaſons, why. As concerning the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is eyther inward, or outward. Inward bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe conſiſteth in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1779:52"/> and ſhewes it ſelfe, when the husband upon every triviall errour, and ſlight offence committed by his wife, is preſently ſo exaſperated againſt her, that thereupon hee begins eyther abſolutely to hate her; or at leaſt to love her in a remiſſe, and careleſſe manner: And being thus affected, though hee ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe, or ſay unto her any thing that is ill; hee takes away yet by his low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lookes the ſweetneſſe of the nuptiall life, and wounds with griefe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content the heart of her, that ſhould be unto him as <hi>the loving Hind, &amp; as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Roe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is outward, and conſiſteth eyther in

                     <hi>David</hi> a <hi>ſharpe ſword.</hi> Twas with this, that ſatan gave ſuch a blow to <hi>Adam,</hi> even in the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1779:53"/> that both himſelfe and his poſterity were quite confounded with the wound. Twas with this, that he made, in a manner the whole Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to fall as they marched thorow the wilderneſſe.

For neyther the crowne of Thornes, wherewith his curſed enemies empaled his tender browes, nor the boyſtrous fiſts, wherewith they buffeted his lovely cheekes; nor yet the whips, wherewith they ploughed his fleſh from up the bones,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1779:54"/> and made deep furrowes in his backe, no nor the ſpeare, wherewith they lanched his heart, could extort from out his mouth the leaſt complaint.

But when he heard his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty traduced, and reviled by their opprobrious, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant tongues, hee was forced to cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> He that was Armour of proofe, againſt all other invaſions, found himſelfe gored to the inmoſt ſoule with this. The Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet therefore not without juſt cauſe, made his Prayer unto the Lord: <hi>that he would protect him ab aſpero verbo,</hi>

                  <p>The later kinde of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bitterneſſe is expreſt in deeds. As when the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band not underſtanding what belongs to conjugall ſociety, doth in every thing ſo curbe, and reſtraine the deſires of his wife, as if ſhe were his vaſſall, a thing not ſutable to the inſtitution of marriage. For when God brought <hi>Eve</hi> unto <hi>Adam,</hi> he did not preſent her as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1779:55"/> or a ſlave, but as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and a helper. <hi>Non es Dominus,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, ſed maritus.</hi> Thou art to be her love,<note place="margin">Hexam. l. <hi>5.</hi> cap. <hi>7.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. By denying her any rule, or ſoveraignety in the houſe, and not ſuffering her ſo much as to command her maides: nay perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſubjecting her to them; But this is contrary to the ordinance of God,

                  <p>Againe, this churliſh pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe is alſo repugnant to the light of nature. <hi>Xenophon</hi>

                     </gap>, to looke to that, which is within. Though the wife therefore may thinke it a pleaſant thing to ſhew her ſelfe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the deſires of her husband: It cannot yet but wring her patience, to ſee her power, and authority in the family, that ſhe may not command her mayde, but muſt rather bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by her.

                  <p n="2">2. This tyranny of the husband over his wife, ſhewes it ſelfe, when ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee denies her that, which doth conduce to her neceſſity, or ſubſtracteth from her any thing conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for her dignity. For by vertue of the matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall covenant, and ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe is to partake in all things with her husband.

As the ſtreames of <hi>Iordan</hi> carry the fiſh with pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, till on a ſodaine they fall into <hi>mare mortuum, The dead Sea,</hi> where they are preſently choaked.

An unkinde Thought will quickly bring forth unkinde Words, and it will not be long ere theſe bee followed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1779:61"/> by unkinde Deeds. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy therefore the <hi>Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice</hi> in the ſhell. <hi>Husbands love your wives, and be not bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto them.</hi> And thus from the <hi>Meanes,</hi> whereby to avoid it, I come now to the <hi>Reaſons,</hi> for which it is to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is drawne from the very Precept by which the Apoſtle enjoyneth Husbands to love their Wives. For it carrieth with it no exception. The bleare-eyed <hi>Leah</hi> muſt bee loved as well as the beauteous <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel;</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> when ſhee chides, as well as when ſhee cheriſheth. For when God firſt impoſed this charge upon the man, hee knew full well there was no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without her weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1779:62"/> As ſhee therefore is bound to bee obedient to her husband, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his many imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo is hee to bee kinde and courteous to his wife: and whenſoever hee ſlackes this affection towards her upon any light occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he becomes guiltie of this <hi>Bitterneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is taken from the example of CHRIST, whom the Apoſtle in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places of his writings propounds as a patterne of imitation unto husbands. For hee never either ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth or deſpiſeth the Church his Spouſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite blemiſhes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which might juſtly make her diſtaſted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1779:62"/> of his purer eyes: but endevours rather to palliate and diſguiſe them, ſtill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring her perſon, though hee bee diſpleaſed with her Faults. And thus diſpoſed ſhould the husband alwaies bee towards his Wife. No inward defect, no outward deformitie ſhould at any time leſſen or abate his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall affection, unleſſe it were ſuch as did diſſolve, &amp; break in ſunder the nuptiall knot. For ſo long as this ſtands firme, the <hi>wife</hi> is but one <hi>fleſh</hi> with himſelfe. And according to the Apoſtle, <hi>No man ever hated his owne fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5.29.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>The third is drawne from a free confeſſion of the very

                  <p>For the manner, how this obedience is to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. It muſt bee with all internall, and externall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. Internally, they muſt conceive a holy eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their parents; and externally, bee ready with all dutifull behaviour to accept of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1779:78"/> The fift precept in the Decalogue is, <hi>Honour thy father, and thy mother,</hi> but the Apoſtle uſeth the word <hi>Obey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, to taxe a fault whereof children for the moſt part are uſually guilty. For many will give all due reſpect and reverence to their parents, who yet in the faſhioning of their lives will deny them their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and with a refracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eare put by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and adviſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is the chiefeſt part of that honour whereunto children by Gods divine injunction are obliged. For vaine is the pretence of honouring them, where there is not a readineſſe to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1779:79"/> obey them; as may be ſeene by that parable of the two ſonnes propounded by our Saviour Chriſt himſelfe to the Prieſts and Elders of the people.<note place="margin">Mat. 21.30.</note> 3.

For the very name of parents can no ſooner ſound in the eare of a child, but it muſt put him in mind that theſe are they, from whom he hath received not onely life, but for the moſt part, foode alſo for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that life, and good education for the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If from them hee have derived his corporall being, then is hee bound by the law of nature to ſubject his will in all things unto theirs. The little Lambe runnes at the call of the damme; and the younger Elephants are alwaies ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1779:80"/> to the directions of the old. Secondly, If from them this being hath beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by a daily ſupply of foode and nouriſhment, then lyes there a morall tye upon him; and by the law of gratefulneſſe hee is to tender unto them all obſervance: and to this the very Storke may inſtruct them. For when his parents by reaſon of their age ly bed-rid, as it were upon their neſt, and are wholly ſtripped of their plumes; he doth not onely bring them foode wherewith to nouriſh them, but ſpreads his pinions forth upon them, and makes his owne Feathers a cover for their nakedneſſe; returning that love to them in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1779:81"/> ſtate, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred gratitude puts him in minde to have received from them in his.

As if nature could not have produced a more lively precedent of piety than this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, If by good diſcipline, and godly education they have bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this his being, hee is then obliged out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his owne uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and gaine to doe the like.

                  <p>I, but will ſome ſay, the things which are enjoyned me by my Parents, are baſe, and ſuch as if I under-went them, would expoſe mee to diſgrace, and make mee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided of the world.

                  <p>Others peradventure will object that their Parents are deſtitute of wiſdome, and diſcretion, and therefore unfit to be obeyed in any thing they ſhall impoſe; but however, my anſwer is, they are not to bee deſpiſed. The Roſe ſmels not the leſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſprings from out a Briar: Neither doth an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond abate of his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſhell.

                  <p>A third ſort, to blanch this dutie from themſelves, will peradventure ſay, <hi>They are not my naturall Parents, but my Stepfather, or Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother.</hi> Be it ſo, yet even theſe muſt bee obeyed.

For ſuch as live in their Fathers houſe, and under their Fathers power, are to be employed by their Parents both at home, and abroad, according as they ſhall thinke fit to make uſe of their ſervice.</p>
                  <p>But as touching ſuch as are married or called to the adminiſtration either of Church or common-weale; though they bee ſtill tyed to reverence, &amp; obey their Parents Will, as likewiſe to ſuccour, and relieve their wants, as oft as occaſion ſhall require: they are not bound yet as before, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitate with them; nor yet
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1779:87"/> to expedite their buſineſſes, as having matters of their owne to looke unto, and thoſe of greater moment and importance. And this is moſt apparent in the firſt ſort. For it is the Ordinance of God himſelfe,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.24.</note> that a man ſhould forſake <hi>Father and Mother, to cleave to his Wife;</hi> which is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>ſimply</hi> but <hi>comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp; in reſpect of an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual ſociety: Again, he muſt labor for the ſuſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation of his owne Family.

                  <p>Now as touching thoſe, that have betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any Church-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, the caſe is cleare. There is no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Parents to revoke them thence, to looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to their terreſtriall affaires. For if a Father can not withdraw his Sonne from the ſervice of an earthly King, much leſſe is hee to doe it from the ſervice of the KING of Kings.

                     </gap>te things ſhould ſtil giue way to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. To reſolve the doubt then in a word. A child can never be freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the duty either of honouring, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving his Parents; but from <hi>Cohabitation,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their domeſticall affaires he may. Here the Phariſees then meet with this condemnation, while devilliſhly they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence with their childrens honouring and relieving of their Parents,<note place="margin">Mat 15.6.</note> ſo they would beſtow it upon them. The Church of Rome, likewiſe hath her
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1779:89"/> blame, while in imitation of their errour, ſhe affirmes it lawfull for children even againſt the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Parents, if once they be come to ripenes of yeares, which in a Sonne they hold to bee at 14. in a daughter at 12. to put themſelves into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery.</p>
                  <p>For 1. to doe a thing not commanded by God, with an apparent violation of that which is commanded, is raſh and irreligious; but for a childe to take upon him the profeſſion of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall life, is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of GODS, whereas to bee ſerviceably obedient unto Parents, is a manifeſt injunction of his: he muſt not therefore aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1779:89"/> them in ſuch a caſe, without their free conſent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is againſt Reaſon, and religion to offer that which is anothers unto God without the approbation of him that owes it. Now children ſo long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine under their Parents tuition, are a part of their peculiar poſſeſſions; and therefore not to bee diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of as they liſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

                  <p>Secondly, that there is

                  <p>Fourthly, that even chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are bound to make conſcience of their waies as farre as they have reaſon to diſcerne good from ill; and muſt endeavour to doe that, which may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God. 'Tis ſayd of <hi>Hieroboams</hi> diſeaſed child; That there was found ſome good thing in him towards the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

                  <p>As touching the firſt; It may be demanded, why the Apoſtle doth here make mention of Fathers onely, not retaining the word Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which hee had uſed before in exacting the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of children, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>aving paſt the two firſt Combinations concurring to the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Familie; the one whereof was betwixt the Husband and the Wife; the other betwixt the Parent, and the childe; wee come now to the third, which is betwixt the Maſter and the Servant; whoſe mutuall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, one towards another being throughly expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, our <hi>Oeconomicks</hi> will be
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1779:136"/> full and compleate.</p>
               <p>Now here as in the two former, the Apoſtle begins with the weakeſt, <hi>Servants.</hi> And 1. he gives them a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. 2. Directs them in their practiſe. In the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> we wil firſt conſider the <hi>Perſons,</hi> on whom it is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; <hi>Servants.</hi> 2. The Duty which thereby is exacted, <hi>Obedience.</hi> 3. The extent of this Duty, how farre it is to reach, and that is, <hi>to all things.</hi> 4. And laſtly, the <hi>Perſons</hi> to whom it is to bee tendred. Generally, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi> Particularly, <hi>Maſters according to the Fleſh.</hi> This is the deduction of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</hi> The direction for their Practiſe, is ſet downe two manner of wayes, <hi>Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp; <hi>Affirmatively. Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:1779:136"/> hee ſhewes the Faults, and Imperfections, which are incident to <hi>Servants,</hi> and would have every Chriſtian to avoid them: For hee would not have the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either <hi>Eye-ſervers,</hi> or <hi>Men-pleaſers. Affirmatively,</hi> he ſeeks to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion them to the contrary; For hee would have their Obedience grounded upon an upright heart, and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the feare of the Lord; <hi>Servants bee obedient in in all things to them, that are your Maſters according to the fleſh, not with Eye-ſervice, as Men-pleaſers, &amp;c.</hi> And thus having ſhewed the ſeverall parts, which muſt bee the ground-worke of our enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe, I returne to the Precept, <hi>Servants obey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Precept was ſo much
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1779:137"/> the more ſeaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſervants in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time being converted to Chriſtianitie, did thinke themſelves hereby exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the yoake of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude; for it ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, that hee, whom Chriſt with his precious blood had redeemed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power of the Devill ſhould continue a ſlave to him, who being not converted to the Faith, was ſtill a ſlave himſelfe unto the Devill. But this opinion was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether erroneous, and no doubt ſuggeſted into the mindes of men, by that great enemy of man, that ſo the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus might bee ſcandalized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the heathen, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other ayme, than
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1779:137"/> utterly to ſubvert all diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. The Apoſtle therfore to ſilence ſuch ſpecious <hi>Plees</hi> preſcribes a contrary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; in which every word is of ſufficient weight to evince both the Equity, and Neceſſitie of what is here enjoyned. For hee ſpake here to Chriſtians, and yet hee did not, call them Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren though indeed they were Brethren, but he ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them Servants.</p>
               <p>The word in the Originall is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and implies, not ſuch attendants, as wee uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally now have. For though wee hire them for wages, their condition yet is free &amp; ingenuous; but ſuch as the ancients uſually had, who were either taken in warre, and ſo were called of the

               <p>And ſuch a kinde of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage may ſtill ſtand with Equity, being uſed with Mercy, &amp; moderation. For,</p>

The Servant is ſtiled his Maſters money. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are objected to the contrary. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some affirme this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile condition to be againſt the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others to bee a fruit of ſinne.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:1779:139"/>
               <p>A third ſort, will have it to bee againſt the Law of Chriſt, who hath purchaſed ſuch a liberty to the world, that now in him all are one.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt kinde of oppoſers ſay, it is againſt the Apoſtles owne Rule, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Bee not any longer the ſervants of men:</hi> To all which I anſwer in order. And firſt to the firſt.</p>
               <p>Every Subjection is not againſt the Law of pure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For even in the ſtate of Innocency, there was a politicke Subjection of the wife to her husband, and of Children unto both. The Image therefore of God, in which wee were created, takes not away all Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only ſuch a Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1779:139"/> as takes away all Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But this can never happen to the baſeſt Slave that is; for though his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter have Dominion over him; hee hath yet domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the Creatures, and this is in him a part of Gods Image.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true, that Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is a fruite of Sinne, and ſo is Sickneſſe, ſo is Death, and ſo are all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temporal puniſhments whatſoever, and yet they ſtill remain; but as in them, ſo likewiſe in this, the curſe is taken away to Gods Chil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ren. Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a liberty both for our ſoules and Bodies; but ſo long as wee live in this World, wee muſt account it a great happines to receive
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1779:140"/> 
                  <hi>primitias, the firſt fruits of it,</hi> and theſe are our ſpirituall liberty from ſinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, from Hell and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, which is a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner to that perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which wee expect in the Kingdome of Heaven, when wee ſhall not onely bee freed from the power of ſinne, as here, but even from all moleſtation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; the ſting of it ſhall bee plucked out, and the Teeth of it ſhall bee broken; It ſhall not bee able then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bite or barke at us any longer; Our enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement, ſhall not onely bee from the evill of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as now it is by Chriſt, but likewiſe from ſervitude it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I grant, that all are
<pb facs="tcp:1779:140"/> made one in Chriſt, and all Diſtinction of Bond, and free is taken away; but how? It is taken away from the Spirituall Body of Chriſt, which is the Church; but not from the outward Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Societies of men here upon Earth: For then there ſhould be likewiſe no diſtinction either of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries or Sexes: There ſhould bee neither <hi>Scythian</hi> nor <hi>Barbarian;</hi> Male nor Female. They are all one in regard of the inward, and ſpirituall man, as alſo in regard of the meanes by which men are led to everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but in regard of the outward Man they ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide Maſters and Servants, Prince and People, Bond &amp; Free, Noble and Ignoble.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1779:141"/> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had converted <hi>Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> a Servant, and a runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, hee did not keepe him yet at Rome, nor diſcharge him his Maſters Service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was <hi>called,</hi> but ſent him backe to <hi>Philemon,</hi> who although in regard of the Faith, hee were to eſteeme him as a Brother, yet his outward condition was to be a Servant ſtill.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Apoſtles owne Rule, <hi>Be no longer the ſervants of men;</hi> It muſt bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is to admit no other Lord than Chriſt, and not otherwiſe: for hee ſpeaks not there of any bodily ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto men; nor is there indeed any one word throughout the whole
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1779:141"/> Scripture, which doth any way countenance a licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous libertie. <hi>Religion</hi> frees no man from his Duty, but rather bindes him the more unto it: Search all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Truth, and ye ſhall finde that the embracing of the Faith was never held a diſpenſation from theſe Tyes. The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore erre, that thinke the Rule and Government of Chriſtians over Chriſtians, repugnant to the freedome of the Goſpell. The Papiſt likewiſe is miſtaken,<note place="margin">Gerſon. qu. <hi>1.</hi> de Poteſt. Eccleſi. ca. <hi>9.</hi> &amp; qu. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> while hee counts Hereſie a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to take away the Soveraignty of Kings, when the Apoſtle here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not Paganiſme to prejudice the authority of a private Maſter over his
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:1779:142"/> Family. If they bee Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, their duty is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; <hi>Servants bee Obedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word in the Original is the ſame, which he uſed unto children; and as there, ſo here it implies;</p>
               <p n="1">1. An humble prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in entertaining the commands of others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A carefull application of our beſt endeavours to a quicke performance of the ſame. Their Obedience muſt expreſſe it ſelfe;</p>
               <p n="1">1. With <hi>Reverence,</hi> and that internally, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; Internally, they muſt not deſpiſe either the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Maſters, or the place, but muſt count them worthy of all Honour, that the name of God and his doctrine bee not evill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.6.</note>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:1779:142"/> of. Externally, their ſpeech and their behaviour muſt bee ſuch as may not ſavour either of contempt, or contumacy. They muſt feare their Maſters. This is that which the Lord himſelfe requireth in all his Servants. <hi>If I bee a Maſter,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>where is my feare? Mal.</hi> 1.6. And in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.5. Our Apoſtle exacteth <hi>feare, and trembling from them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Maſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Character of their Obedience muſt be Patience. They muſt endure without reſiſtance, rebukes and Corrections, bee they never ſo bitter, and unjuſt. For if when we do well,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.20.</note> and ſuffer wrong, wee take it patiently, this is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God. <hi>Agar</hi> being
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1779:143"/> roughly dealt withall by <hi>Sarai,</hi> ranne away, and would not abide her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, but the Lord by an Angell did controll this courſe, &amp; adviſed her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home to her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, and to humble her ſelfe under her hand. A Servant may lawfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe, ſo it be done conveniently, and without deſpiſing his Maſters au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, till the fury of his unjuſt anger be allayed. For ſo <hi>David</hi> conveighed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from <hi>Saul;</hi> and the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian that directed <hi>David</hi> to the Amalekits made him ſweare,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.15.</note> not to deliver him into the hands of his Maſter from whom hee was fled; neither did <hi>David</hi> ſinne in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <p>
                  <hi>In all things.</hi> A Servant, like a Bow in the hand of his Maſter muſt not be ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or unbended, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>I am a man in authority,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Centu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1779:144"/> unto one, Goe, and he goeth; to another, Come, and hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; and to a third, Doe this, and hee doth it.</hi> But there are ſome of that ſturdy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that if the things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them doe any way croſſe their credit, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice their profit, diſturbe their eaſe, or are contrary to their liking, they will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not doe them at all, or they will doe them with a left hand, and as they liſt themſelves. Their uſuall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint is, that the maſter whom they ſerve is a chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Nabal;</hi> and one that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth all humanitie, both in exacting, and rewarding the ſervice that is done him. But this is not enough to unyoke them from their <hi>Obedience.</hi> For though they
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1779:144"/> receive no comfort from their maſters; God yet, to whom, and for whom they doe their ſervice, will not leave them unrequited. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſerved a hard <hi>Laban</hi> 21 yeares; In the day hee melted away with heate; in the night he was benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with cold; yea the very ſleepe departed from his Eyes, that nothing might miſcarry, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge; all which <hi>Laban</hi> regarded not; but God in the end requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his care, and travaile in a large meaſure. And ſurely whatſoever a man doth, that ſhall hee receive of the Lord, whether he be bond,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.8.</note> or free. And therefore <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants bee obedient in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:1779:145"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>In all things</hi> .i. in all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and lawfull. Even Servants muſt look to that ſupreme <hi>Power,</hi> whereunto their Maſters are but ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, and bee wary of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the one, which they know to bee counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the other. The Maſter of our fleſh is to bee obeyed ſo farre as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands not that, which is forbidden by the Maſter of our Spirit, ſaith Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome.</hi> They which pleaſe them in this kinde are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemned. It is ſaid of <hi>Pharaoh, That both hee and his ſervants ſinned.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed many are contented to proſtitute their beſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to their Maſters moſt
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1779:145"/> adulterate deſignes. <hi>Abſalons</hi> followers were very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in ſmiting of <hi>Amnon;</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to ſpit in the face of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, &amp; to buffet him with their hands.<note place="margin">Mat. 26, 67</note> Let a great one make a ſcoffe of Religion, and preſently his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants to keepe him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will doe the like. As there are Flatterers in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Courts, ſo alſo are there in private cottages. Many Apprentices, and Iourney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, will never bee unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of a Lie or an Oath; that they may fill their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters houſes, as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>by bribery</hi> and <hi>cruelty;</hi> whereas indeed, they ſhould humour them no farther than ſtands with the ſafety of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1779:146"/> The Servants of wicked <hi>Saul</hi> were none of the beſt, yet they refuſed to execute his unjuſt ſentence upon the Prieſts of the Lord; though his commands had beene enough to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the deed. Let Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Servants therefore much more abhorre to pleaſe any Fleſh ſo farre, as to diſpleaſe the Lord. The Apoſtle aymes not at a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and irreligious <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> he onely forbids ſuch a dimidiated, and arbitrary ſubjection, as Servants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are willing to tender, when he ſaith, <hi>Servants bee obedient in all things.</hi> This for the extent. The Perſons follow, to whom this Duty muſt be tendred, and that is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:1779:146"/> generally, <hi>Maſters;</hi> Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, <hi>Maſters according to the fleſh.</hi>

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The very Title ſpeakes the Equity of the Precept, as well as that of Servants. For as the word <hi>Servant</hi> intimates an Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to bee exhibited to to another; ſo the name of Maſter implies a due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to bee exacted from another. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a Maſter, muſt bee obeyed, whether hee bee rich or poore, kind or crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, a true beleever or a falſe. The Apoſtle ſets it downe indefinitely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difference of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Servants bee obedient to them that are your Maſters;</hi> And we muſt underſtand it likewiſe without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:1779:147"/> of Sexe. For the <hi>Head</hi> of the Family, bee it Man, or woman, muſt be obeyed. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.14. No <hi>Salik Law</hi> for the cutting off of this. But to paſſe by this; why doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Obey your Maſters according to the Fleſh?</hi> What needed this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? I anſwer, that this may bee referred eyther to Maſters, or Servants. If to Maſters, the ſenſe is this, That Servants muſt bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient even to ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as are fleſhly, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men. And indeed what greater praiſe can happen to a Chriſtian man, than to ſhew himſelfe a <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in the houſe of a <hi>Putiphar?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If to ſervants, they ſerve as a limitation, &amp; ſhew them to bee ſubject onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

               <p n="1">1. Hee may bee ſaid to ſerve in <hi>ſingleneſſe of Heart,</hi> who eyes not the condition of his Maſter; but whether hee bee rich or poore, milde or moody, hee conſiders his Authority, and thereto ſuites his Obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1779:160"/> are ſervants, who like lying Hennes, will make a great deale of cackling, though they ſeldome Lay. Like a Mill that is looſe hung, they keepe a mighty clack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but grinde no Griſt. I may liken them to naſtie dung-hils, that are covered over with Snow; an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diligence diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth their inward ſloth: like the Partridges of <hi>Paphlagonia</hi> they have two hearts, the one pious, and officious, ſtirring them up to all dutifull obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo long as the Maſter looketh on; the other impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inofficious, moving them as ſoone as his backe is turned to fraud and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; but hee that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <hi>ſingleneſſe of Heart,</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:1779:160"/> hath but one heart, and that is ever like it ſelfe; as pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full being alone, as if he had the world for his ſpectator.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, hee may bee ſaid to ſerve in <hi>ſingleneſſe of heart,</hi> that ſerves with a faithfull heart. Now this faithfulneſſe in a ſervant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it ſelfe, in ſeverall things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the diligent and ready performance of what his Maſter ſhall enjoyne him. Yee may ſee it in him, whom <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent to ſeek a wife for his ſonne <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Having received his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he preſently began his journey, and being upon the way hee invocated the the God of his Maſter for the good ſucceſſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of his buſineſſe; and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:1779:161"/> when hee was come to the houſe of <hi>Bethuel,</hi> hee could not bee drawne to taſte a morſell of meate, till he had delivered his meſſage; but ſervants now a dayes, I ſpeake for the greater part, are like <hi>Phoebus</hi> his Crow, they may be ſent in haſte,<note place="margin">Ovid. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Faſt.</note> they will returne at leaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the concealment of his counſels and Secrets, a thing wherein ſervants are uſually too too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective. For indeed they may bee counted ſo many ſpies in the houſe, whoſe common practiſe is, where they may be heard, to blaze abroad, whatſoever may tend to their Maſters or Miſtreſſes reproach; having at once caſt off, both the

Nay, they cannot cough or ſneeſe, but they are ſure of rebukes, if not of blowes; yet theſe are onely naturall infirmities, and cannot bee ſuppreſſed, when the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taketh us. No marvell therefore, if theſe, that may not ſpeake before their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:1779:164"/> delight themſelves in ſpeaking of their Maſters; whereas others, whoſe mouthes are not ſowed up in this manner, have often ſet their own life at nought for the preſervation of theirs. <hi>In conviviis loque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur, ſed intormentis tace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant;</hi> they talke at the table, but in the middeſt of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are as ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as the dead of night, and will not bee made to finde a Tongue wherewith to betray, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the life or reputation of their Lord.</p>
               <p>If thou haſt a ſervant therefore, treate him with love like a Brother. <hi>Sit tibi quaſi anima tua,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe-man,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 33.29.</note>

               <p>God often payes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Perſon with his owne Coyne; hee ſcourgeth him with his own rod; bringing upon ſuch as have bin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull ſervants, povertie, want, or other worſe cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, &amp; that by the means of unfaithfull ſervants, that their ſinne may returne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let them know, that the onely way to learne how wee ſhould rightly uſe our own portion of Goods, is by the carefull uſe of other mens, as they ſhall
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:1779:169"/> happen to come into our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. For he that wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rioteth and conſumeth his maſters Goods,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.12.</note> is for the moſt part given over by Gods juſt judgement, to bee a waſter of his owne. Let every ſervant of man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if he deſire to bee the true ſervant of God, labour in all his courſes to ſhew a ſingle heart; For <hi>better is the poore in the uprightneſſe of his heart, than hee that abuſeth his lipps, and is a foole.</hi> Yea let us all take heed, that Sathan beguile us not from the ſimplicitie that is in Chriſt Ieſus. And thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the faſhioning of a ſervants Obedience, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true modell <hi>Singleneſſe of heart.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:1779:170"/> followes, and that is the <hi>Feare of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The onely thing indeed, which will make all our wayes, words and workes to ſavour of ſimplicity and ſincerity. As the cauſe therefore with the effect, the Apoſtle hath placed it, with <hi>Singleneſſe of heart,</hi> and that right well. For he that feareth and regardeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man in the performance of any duty, will prove wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering &amp; unconſtant, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guided and directed by an unconſtant rule. For the <hi>Feare</hi> of man takes no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion longer than hee is preſent; but the <hi>Feare</hi> of God ſtands firme in the breſts of the godly, becauſe they have him ever before their eyes, and hee neither
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:1779:170"/> ought, nor can at any time bee imagined as abſent. The very Stoick could affirme, that there is a God within,<note place="margin">Epictetus.</note> &amp; a good Angel evermore about us, &amp; that they need no light to looke into the nature of our actions. What was that, which preſerved <hi>Ioſeph</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Siren</hi> inca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an adulterous &amp; luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miſtris, but the <hi>fear of the Lord? How can I doe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>this great wickedneſſe, and ſo ſinne againſt my God?</hi> Had he been a meere man-pleaſer, he might, and would no doubt have ſatisfied her lewd demands; but becauſe he reverenced his Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Maſter, he could not doe that injury to his terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. It is the <hi>feare of God,</hi> which muſt reſtraine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:1779:171"/> from whoring, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtealing, gaming, and other the like prodigious and enormous courſes. It is the <hi>feare of God,</hi> which muſt make them diligent and faithfull in their buſineſſe; as knowing, that though the eye of their Maſter bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet that of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker is upon them, who will not winke at their errour, but will ſeverely puniſh their offence. In a word, it is the <hi>feare of God</hi> which will move them with <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, daily to powre forth their prayers to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the behalfe of their Maſter, and the reſt of the family, &amp; for the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his owne endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Servants then muſt learne from hence, ſo to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:1779:171"/> in their ſeverall places and functions, as to feare God, even that God. 1. Who ſet them in that Calling. 2. Whoſe eyes are evermore upon them, watching and obſerving with what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence they diſcharge their duties in thoſe Callings.</p>
               <p>Againe, Maſters muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo learne, if they would have painfull and truſty ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to chuſe ſuch as are religious; and frame to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſuch as they have choſen; that knowing what it is to bee ſubject to their Maſter in heaven, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may compell them to bee ſubject to their earthly Maſter alſo. Wouldſt thou have thy ſervant to pleaſe thee in <hi>all things?</hi> worke him firſt to pleaſe God in
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:1779:172"/> 
                  <hi>all things:</hi> Wouldſt thou finde him faithfull? ſee then hee bee a <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> that will not ſinne, and bee unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Lord. Wouldſt thou have him profitable? ſee hee bee an <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> and then, howſoever in times paſt he were never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, he will bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to thee and others.</p>
               <p>Commonly, all that if ſtood upon in the choice os ſervants, is onely skill an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie for thoſe ſervices, wherein we purpoſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them. So it is ſaid of <hi>Salomon, Hee ſaw Hieroboam was a man fit for the worke.</hi> But as for Religion, no great matter is made of that, and yet it is all in all. For I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch, the ungodly ſervant, how fit ſo ever hee may
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:1779:172"/> ſeeme for our turnes, to bee unprofitable; and that a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant fearing God, though comming farre ſhort of the other in wit, knowledge, and dexterity for the well managing of buſineſſes, ought yet to bee preferred before him, as farre more profitable.</p>
               <p>For firſt, the evill ſervant drawes the curſe of GOD upon all his indeavours, ſo that many times the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſuch a one, like that of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> doth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh into fooliſhneſſe; whereas on the contrary, by vertue of Gods bleſſing, proſpering what ever the righteous man takes in hand,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.3.</note> even his fooliſhneſſe and ſimplicity, in reſpect of the deepe policies of the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:1779:173"/> wicked man is turned into wiſedome, and ſorteth to a very good and happy effect. When <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Putiphars</hi> affaires, and <hi>Iacob</hi> of <hi>Labans,</hi> all things were well. <hi>The little of the juſt man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pf. 37.16.</note> ſaith <hi>David, is more than great riches of the wicked.</hi> It is ſpoken there of his wealth; but it is true like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of his wit, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gifts of his minde, as of the outward Goods of this life. A little wit, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle skill, and a little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in a godly ſervant, ſhall goe farther, and prove more advantagious to his Maſter, than twice as much in an evill ſervant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The wicked ſervant doth not onely bring the curſe of God upon himſelfe
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:1779:173"/> and his endevours, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole family wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he lives. So <hi>Achan</hi> endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered the whole Army; <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> the whole ſhip, in which they were; whereas on the contrary, for a godly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſake, other in the houſe have fared the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Such a one is like the Arke of God under the Roofe of <hi>Obed-Edom.</hi>

               <p>Neither are ungodly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unprofitable onely to the body, but alſo to the ſoule, infecting all that are about them with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of their corrupt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; whereas the other by their good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lives adorne the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:1779:174"/> of Chriſt, and cauſe it to appeare beautifull in the eyes even of profane and irreligious Maſters, gaining them often times to the love, and liking thereof, even as the beleeving wife doth the unbeleeving hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Maſters therefore muſt either chuſe ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as are religi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But what ſhall Maſters doe, that their ſervants may bee ſuch?</p>
               <p n="1">1. They muſt cauſe them to pray, and reade the Scriptures in their private houſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They muſt bring them to the publike hearing of them in the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:1779:174"/>3. They ſhould be a light and a Lanthorne to them themſelves. <hi>Peſsima defluxio quae provenit à capite;</hi> A ſicke head diſtempers all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts; and a darke eye makes a darke body.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, they muſt reſtraine them from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane company, and allow them libertie at convenient times to converſe with ſuch as feare God. While <hi>Saul</hi> was amongſt the Prophets, himſelfe did likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie. Let it be a fragrant flower, or a ſtinking weed, which we handle, our Fingers will bee ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſmell. <hi>Iudas</hi> was honeſt while hee converſed with Chriſt: 'twas after hee had conferred with the Prieſts and Elders, that out
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:1779:175"/> of a greedy deſire of the wages of unrighteouſneſſe, hee plotted the death of his innocent, and harmleſſe Maſter. And thus much concerning the ſecond thing required to the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of a Servants obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the true modell, it is the <hi>feare of God;</hi> I come now to the third, <hi>Whatſoever they doe, they muſt doe it heartily.</hi> And here we will, 1. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duty. 2. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement thereunto. As concerning the Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoever they doe they muſt doe it,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with a heart, and a ſoule. The word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they ſhould doe what their Maſters enjoyne them chearefully, and as it were for their life, without
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:1779:175"/> any murmuring, or repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And it is very likely that ſome Chriſtian ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles obeied their maſters more for the neceſſity of their condition, than any willingneſſe they had unto it. S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore ſeekes to cure this evill, when hee commands them to doe whatſoever they doe, <hi>freely, from their heart,</hi> and without any enforcement.</p>
               <p>Now then may wee bee ſaid to doe a thing with our heart, when the heart not onely deſires to doe it, but withall rejoyceth, and is much delighted in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. On the contrary, when the heart holds off, and is a verſe and refractary, though the outward work
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:1779:176"/> be done, it is done yet one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the hand, and not with the heart. For as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper</hi> well, <hi>Si quid invitus fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceris, fit de te magis quàm fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis;</hi> If wee doe any thing unwillingly, it may rightly be ſaid to be done by <hi>us,</hi> but it cannot be ſaid to be done of <hi>us;</hi> and in this our maſter hath no more from us, than hee hath from his Aſſe, or from his Oxe, a meere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted labour; and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward can wee expect for this? <hi>Animus eſt, qui parva extollit; ſordida illuſtrat; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, &amp; in pretio habita dehone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat.</hi> It is onely the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde, ſaith the Moralliſt, which gives the forme to ever thing, and makes it either reſpected, or diſreſpected both of God
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:1779:176"/> and man. It was the hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the poore Widdow in the Goſpell, which made her two Mites be ſo applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by our Saviour, when the large offerings of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were not a jot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. The Souldier that brought a little water in his Helmet to his Soveraigne, was more regarded of him than the greateſt of thoſe Peeres that courted him with coſtly preſents. It is in ſervice, as it is in ſacrifice; if the heart be wanting, it can never be acceptable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that hee ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; hee ſheweth, that ſervants ſhould not onely expreſſe life in their actions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:1779:177"/> than they doe of his commands. And indeed theſe are things for the moſt part combined one to the other. For no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can go chearefully about a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, unleſſe hee love and reſpect the perſon that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth it. And therefore in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.7. It is expreſly ſet downe, that they ſhould ſerve <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>with good will.</hi> And indeed according to S. <hi>Ambroſe, Nemo melius obtemperat, quàm qui ex cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate obſequitur.</hi> None ſerve like thoſe, that ſerve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they love. And thus much concerning the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the Inducement fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the Lord, and not to men:</hi> that is, as they who rather and more principally
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:1779:177"/> ſerve the Lord, than men, even in the peformance of thoſe offices which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited unto men. For though the uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the worke bee to redound to man, the minde of the worker yet is to look ſpecially unto God. And here wee muſt note, that the <hi>Negative particle,</hi> doth not inferre it, an unlawfull thing to ſerve men, or in ſerving to regard them. It only ſhews, that in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all Duties wee ſhould not look ſo much to our earthly Lord, as to Chriſt our heavenly Lord. It is a knowne rule in the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy Writ, <hi>In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parationibus ſaepe negari illud, quod non eſt excludendum, ſed tantum alteri poſtponendum:</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:1779:178"/> that in compariſons a thing many times is denyed, which muſt not yet bee ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly excluded, but onely poſtpoſed to another; as in <hi>Marke</hi> 9.37. <hi>Whoſoever recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour Chriſt <hi>receiveth not mee, but him that ſent me.</hi> .i. hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Father that ſends, more, than me that am ſent; for hee receiveth mee for his ſake. And ſo in this place. <hi>Whatſoever ye doe, doe it heartily as to the Lord and not to me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </hi> .i. to Chriſt your Lord rather than to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is for his ſake that ye ſerve them. And indeed there is great reaſon, why even in vile and externall duties they ſhould bee ſaid rather to obey God, than men, though they doe
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:1779:178"/> them wholly at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and onely for their profit.</p>
               <p>For firſt, they which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey are Chriſts by right, more than their earthly Lords: They bought them to be their ſervants with gold, and Silver; but Chriſt bought them to be his with no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſe price than with the effuſion of his owne moſt precious blood; they redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y the body, &amp; that no farther than out of one ſervitude into another; but Chriſt hath ranſomed both ſoule and body into a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty, that ſhall laſt for ever; and therfore Chriſt is to bee ſerved before them. 2. Our earthly Maſters are to bee obeyed no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than Chriſt preſcribes;
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:1779:179"/> they are to him as a ſteward to a Noble man; hee hath the command of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Servants; but if he command any thing that is contrary to the will of the Lord, they are to ſuſpend their obedience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt himſelfe hath declared it to bee his will and pleaſure, that <hi>Servants ſhould obey their Maſters;</hi> and in his wiſedome and power he hath ordeyned ſome for ſoveraignty, and ſome for ſubjection; All which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, Chriſtian ſervants may be rightly ſaid, even in the performance of any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their Maſter, to ſerve the Lord, and not men. And it is a great motive to doe whatſoever wee doe, heartily, conſidering that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:1779:179"/> the eye of Chriſt can ſcrue it ſelfe into our inmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates; and that in every Action, hee more regards the heart, than the hand.</p>
               <p>The defects of men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men in their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ariſe from a want of feare and reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God. We have it from the mouth of a Heathen, That he who behaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe impiouſly and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly towards him, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee <hi>Single-hearted</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man. In all the works therefore of our vocation, wee muſt ſtudie rather to keepe a good Conſcience, than to gaine the applauſe of men. For how laudible ſo ever our outward Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may ſeeme, it is but hypocriticall and adulterate
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:1779:180"/> if referred to an ill end. A Chriſtian ſervant muſt not think it enough to pleaſe his earthly Lord unleſſe withal hee pleaſe Chriſt who is his heavenly one. To conclude, this is the manner of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian obedience, that every faithfull man ſhould ſo doe the workes of his Calling, as if there were none in the world beſides God, and himſelfe. For then hee will not dare to doe thoſe offices for men, which he knowes are hatefull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but will ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo farre ſerviceable to the one, as that he may bee truely ſerviceable to the other. And thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Precept impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon ſervants, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Obedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:1779:180"/> at their hands. Now follow the Inducements which muſt ſtirre them up to the tender of this Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; &amp; theſe are drawne from thoſe things, which uſually make the greateſt impreſſion in the mindes of men, Reward and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In handling of the former we will conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The qualitie of the Reward propoſed. It is a Reward of inheritance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Perſon from whom it is to bee expected, and that is the Lord; <hi>Yee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The certainty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it; <hi>Yee know that hee ſhall receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this certainty. For <hi>Yee ſerve the Lord Chriſt.</hi> As
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:1779:181"/> touching the quality of the Reward.</p>
               <p>It is the Reward of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. But in this may ſome ſay, lyes a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For a Reward is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly that, which wee give unto ſervants; an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which wee bequeath to ſonnes. Whereunto I anſwere, that the Apoſtle ſpeakes not of any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Reward, which might in worth bee correſpondent to their labour, but of that eternall beatitude, which God conferreth upon his Saints, and which farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth the worth and excellency of all humane obſequiouſneſſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: and he cals it, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:1779:192"/> and that themſelves are oppreſſed, and caſt downe on every ſide, they <hi>know</hi> yet, that hee who raiſed up the Lord Ieſus Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo raiſe up them at the later day, and for all the light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany afflictions, which they have endured here, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them with an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding weight of glory; <hi>They know it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed Faith ſhould be confident; <hi>By Faith yee ſtand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle; And <hi>By Faith wee live,</hi> ſaith the Prophet;<note place="margin">Abac. 2.</note> It is the very ſoule &amp; Spirit of the inward Man. If wee beleeve not, wee are dead to God-ward; and his ſoule will take no pleaſure in us. <hi>Woe unto him,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe man, <hi>that hath a double
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:1779:192"/> heart, and to the wicked lippes, and faint hands, and to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that goeth two manner of wayes. Woe to him that is faint-hearted, for hee beleeveth not; therefore ſhall he not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</hi> It is not the property of <hi>faith</hi> to waver like a Reed to and fro; nor of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, like a Wave of the Sea, to be ever rowling. We are willed therefore to come to the Throne of Grace with boldnes, &amp; not to caſt away that confidence, which hath great recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but to truſt perfectly in that grace, which is brought unto us by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>IESVS CHRIST.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Qui dubius eſt, infidelis erit,</hi> ſaith an eminent Father; Doubt quickly turnes into
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:1779:193"/> diſtruſt. For they which receive not the love of the Truth, that they may bee ſaved, the Lord ſhall ſend them <hi>ſtrong deluſions,</hi>

               <p>It was Chriſts admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Church of <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atira; That which ye have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,

The confidence of of a true Chriſtian is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> being caſt into the lanched boſome of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſlipp a little, but it will ſoon take hold againe; It is a Sun,<note place="margin">Tert. de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anima. c. <hi>41.</hi> &amp; cap. <hi>53.</hi>
                  </note> which for a time may bee overcaſt, but on a ſuddaine the cloud ſhall bee diſperſed; and it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with greater luſtre. It is a Fire, which for a while may lie concealed under the Aſhes, but at length it breaketh forth into a brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter flame. Like the Arke, it may be taken by the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins; but maugre all their
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:1779:194"/> malice, it ſhall with joy and triumph bee returned back to Iſrael. The ſweet perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which the godly have of everlaſting happineſſe, may bee often ſhaken, but can never be ſhattered; they may be bowed by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Tempeſt, but ſhall never bee broken. They ſhall come againe to their former vigour; And howſoever they end their lives; whether by the hand of Tyranny, or by the teeth of wilde Beaſts; they goe away with a ſentence of peace in their lipps; as <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah Dove,</hi> when it reverted with an Olive Branch to the Arke; <hi>Chriſt is my life, and death is my advantage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knowing,</hi> that is, being thorowly aſſured, that they

               </p>
               <p>And ſhall the baſe &amp; ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar workes of poore and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts then be thus rewarded? why this muſt animate and encourage us, not to grow weary of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:1779:195"/> well doing, but to goe on in all holy &amp; religious courſes; For ſurely the great works of piety in Gods ſervice ſhal bee more highly rewarded. Againe, ſhall the workes of ſervants bee rewarded? Here is matter then of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for them, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reproofe for thoſe, who being the children of God, are many times yet ſo overborne by unbeliefe, that they diſtruſt the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their prayers, and good indeavours. For God will have them <hi>know,</hi> that they ſhall receive from him a <hi>Reward of Inheritance;</hi> than which nothing is ſurer a mans owne.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the third point, <hi>The certainty of receiving that which Chriſt
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:1779:195"/> hath promiſed.</hi> I come now to the fourth and laſt, and that is the Reaſon, whereupon this certainty is grounded; <hi>For yee ſerve the Lord Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wages</hi> and <hi>Workes</hi> are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives.</hi> And therefore E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity requireth, that from him a <hi>Reward</hi> ſhould bee expected, to whom our labour is exhibited.</p>
               <p>But how may ſome ſay, Can it bee deemed a credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and likely thing, that they which undergoe baſe offices for men here upon earth ſhould bee ſaid herein to ſerve Chriſt, who is now all glorious, and hath his reſidence in the higheſt heavens, where he hath the ful miniſterie of <hi>Angels,</hi> and needeth not at all the obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſneſſe
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:1779:196"/> of Man?</p>
               <p>The anſwer is at hand, and hath already beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>viz.</hi> that whatſoever ſervices are done to men at the command of Chriſt, and for the glory of Chriſt, are held as done to Chriſt himſelfe. For as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> rightly upon this place, ſaith, <hi>Servit DEO, qui propter Deum ſervit homini:</hi> Hee may bee truely ſaid to ſerve God, that ſerveth man for Gods ſake. Yea Chriſt verifies it himſelfe, when hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.40 et v. ult.</note> 
                  <hi>In as much as ye did it to one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye did it to mee.</hi> And againe, <hi>In as much as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not unto me.</hi> This is there ſpoken only of works of charity, as men either
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:1779:196"/> doe them, or deny them, one to the other; but it may bee extended to all ſuch Workes of Obedience, as are preſcribed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned us by GOD. For when wee doe them unto men, wee doe them unto him, that commanded them to bee done and when wee deny them unto them, hee counts them as denyed unto himſelfe, and not without juſt cauſe. For hee who being commanded by God to obey Men, ſhall refuſe to ſubmit himſelfe to humane authority, would, if he were able, exempt himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all from that which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. When the Iſraelites therfore wold no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the rule of <hi>Samuel</hi> but would have a King to raigne
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:1779:197"/> over them;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7.7.</note> 
                  <hi>They have not,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>caſt thee away, but they have caſt mee away, that I ſhould not raigne over them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from hence we may learne.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, or Bondage, which is not honourable, if men demeſne themſelves, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in honeſtly, and faithfully. For they which are ſuch, are ſervants unto Chriſt; and to retaine to him, is the very noone-point of all dignity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is no rule or principality, that can vindicate a wicked man from ſhame and from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. For ſuch are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the Devill, which is the very depth of miſery and diſhonour. And thus
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:1779:197"/> much concerning the firſt inducement, by which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would ſtirre up <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to Obedience; The promiſe of Reward.</hi> I come now to the ſecond, <hi>A threatning of Puniſhment. But hee that doth wrong, ſhal receive for the wrong which he hath done, and there is no reſpect of perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of this, wee will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Commination</hi> denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt all, that ſhall prove defective in their duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An <hi>Anticipation</hi> of a ſecret Objection, which might ſeeme to weaken, infringe the certainety of this puniſhment, in theſe words, <hi>Neither is there reſpect of perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the firſt;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:1779:198"/> Some take it as denounced againſt tyrannous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Maſters, to the comfort of the ſervant, that is ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. For it is no other than if hee ſhould have ſaid; Though Maſters be wicked and cruell, doe not yee yet ſuſpend your Obedience, but performe that which is your dutie, and leave the revenge to God; For at his hands they ſhall receive what ever wrong they doe. Now wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Maſters may many wayes prove injurious to their ſervants.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By defrauding them of neceſſary food and raiment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By denying them their due wages.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By urging them to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that are above he
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:1779:198"/> ſtrength of their Body.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By wounding their very ſoules with virulent reproaches.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By bruiſing, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even their Bones with undeſerved ſtrokes. All which calamities in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hapned to the people of God during their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in Aegypt. That ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants therefore may not through impatience riſe up againſt their Lords, or through diſcouragement neglect the offices, which are impoſed upon them, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells them, that whoſoever he bee that ſhall thus oppreſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>He ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that he hath done.</hi> .i. He ſhal perceive and feele the vengeance of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, proportioning his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:1779:199"/> according to his injuſtice. A proofe of this wee have upon the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, whom God afflicted with farre greater plagues, than they were able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict his Iſraelites. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21.9</note> who was puniſhed in his poſteritie for the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> whom hee had ſlaine, thinking to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thereby the people, becauſe they were not of the <hi>ſeed of Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other Interpreters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it unto ſervants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhould have ſaid, If the hope of a Celeſtiall reward cannot draw you to your duty, let the feare yet of a grievous puniſhment drive you ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: Bee not injurious to your Maſters either out of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:1779:199"/> ſtubbornneſſe, or ſloth. For GOD the righteous Iudge will with ſeverity exact the forfeiture of your improbitie: and of this we have an example in <hi>Gehezi,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.26. But with Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> I thinke that both interpretations are to be conjoyned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeakes generally to all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe this Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is inſerted betwixt the duties of ſervants and Maſters, that ſo it might ſeeme equally to appertaine to both. So that this I take to bee the meaning of the <hi>Apoſtle, He that doth wrong,</hi> whether it be the Maſter, in miſuſing of his ſervant; or the ſervant in defrauding, and deſpiſing of his Maſter,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:1779:200"/> either ſhall receive from God, the wrong that hee hath done. We muſt learne from hence then;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That every ſinne ſhall meete with puniſhment from God, though perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it may ſcape the ſeverity of men; and what will it availe us to have avoyded their hands, when wee ſhall fall into his?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That earthly Lords, how great ſoever they may be in power, are no way priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or permitted to make litter for their ambitious feet, of thoſe that are under their authoritie. For even they themſelves are under God; And as the <hi>Trigaedian</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Omne ſub regno majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re regnum eſt;</hi> No power
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:1779:200"/> ſo great, but it is ſubject to a greater. All muſt be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That thoſe men of all others are the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that count it their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe to tyrannize over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Sylla</hi> did; for they ſhall receive the wrong they doe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, <hi>Eye-ſervers</hi> and <hi>Men-pleaſers</hi> ſuch as by a deceitfull ſhewe of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, gaine the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Maſters are here taught, that they lie ſtill expoſed to the wrath of God. For hee, who is their heavenly Lord diſcernes their fraud, and their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. <hi>Quaecunque facio, ante te facio,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine, &amp; illud quicquid eſt quod facio, melius tu vides, quam ego, qui
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:1779:201"/> facio;</hi> Whatſoever O Lord, I doe, I doe it before thee; and it is more apparent to thy eyes, than to mine that doe it. It behoves every one therefore to have a care, that what hee doth be well done. And thus much of the Commination. The Anticipation followeth, <hi>And there is no reſpect of perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Maſters might object and ſay; Who ſhall call us into judgement for the ill uſage of a ſlave? The very Law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, that no injurie can bee done to them. But ſay we ſhould be queſtioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; we will evade either by favour out of the hands of Iuſtice, or by force; or if not ſo, a Bribe ſhal charme the uprightnes
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:1779:201"/> of the Iudge. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> meets with theſe conceits; and ſhewes that it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with divine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than with humane. Earthly Tribunals are like ſpiders webbs, the harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Flie ſticks faſt, while the hurtfull Hornet brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth through. But this great judge of heaven and earth, will not be terrified by any power of the wicked, nor yet made flexible by favor, Hee accepteth not,<note place="margin">Iob 34.19.</note> as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeakes, the perſons of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, neither regardeth hee the rich more, than the poore; for they bee all the workes of his hands. And ſutable to this is that of S. <hi>Ambroſe Iuſtus Index eſt domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, cauſas diſcernit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Eph. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonas;</hi> The Lord is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:1779:202"/> Iudge, and regardeth not the Perſon, but the Plee. Hee heares the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the priſoners, and hath a liſtening eare to the cries of thoſe that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto death; nor ſhall the wrong they ſuffer ſcape the fury of his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. I reade in profane Story of one <hi>Autronius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Macrob. l. <hi>1.</hi> Saturn.</note> who having firſt of all moſt inhumanely whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped one of his ſlaves, did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards faſten him to a Gibbet, and on a ſolemne Feſtivall before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their ſhewes, did cauſe him in that miſerable plight to bee carried up and downe the place, as if hee had intended him, like an Antick to a Maske, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall <hi>praeludium</hi> to their

A cruelty ſo barbarous, and void of all humanity, that <hi>Iupiter,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the ſpectacle, appeared in the night to one <hi>Annio,</hi> willing him to let the Senate underſtand, that hee did much abhorre it; and without ſome ſpeedy expiation of the crime, would viſit them and their ſtate with extraordinary judgement, which hee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, the one and onely Son he had was taken from him by ſodaine death; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards being warned hereof againe, for the like careleſneſſe, himſelfe was ſtrucken with a weakneſſe throughout his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſo that in the end, by the adviſe of his friends, he was carried in a Litter to
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:1779:203"/> the Senate-houſe, where he had no ſooner related what had beene diſcovered unto him, but his health was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reſtored, and hee went on foote out of the Court backe to his owne home; out of which he came not but by the helpe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is attributed to <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but was the Act of the true God, whoſe eyes, and ears are alwayes open to the afflicted; the remembrance of it may ſerve as a Bridle to curbe the arrogance of maſters, and to keepe them from all inſolent oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſervants might likewiſe object and ſay; What though we obey not our earthly Maſters <hi>heartily?</hi> And what though wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:1779:203"/> them ſometimes, as occaſion ſhall bee offered; will GOD take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for it upon us poore ſilly ſoules? Great is the burthen of our ſorrowes, and many be the miſeries, which wee endure by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their imperious haughtineſſe. God will not therefore ſurely adde unto our griefe by any exerciſe of his ſeverity, but will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make us taſte of his mercy. The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to cut off this vaine hope likewiſe even in them, ſhewes, that God is juſt, and will not be moved out of pity to favour the poore, nor out of envy to detract from the rich. Hee hath expreſly prohibited this reſpect of Perſons in
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:1779:204"/> others, and cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore practiſe it himſelfe. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.3. <hi>Thou ſhalt not eſteeme,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the poore man in his cauſe.</hi> And in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Ye ſhall not doe uniuſtly in iudgement.

               <p>From hence then wee may learne,</p>
               <p n="1">1.

Men flie to both in caſe of danger, and neceſſitie. That hee may be therefore both, he muſt know it is his duty to protect the Peſant, as wel as the Peere; the ſlave as well as the ſuperiour. And thus I here breake off the thred of this diſcourſe, in which if any chance to taxe mee for the length, I muſt
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:1779:205"/> unburden my ſelfe upon the Apoſtles method, which gave mee the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It was my reſolution at the firſt, fully to ponde and examine every word of his, that from them I might derive the greater weight unto mine owne. In hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therefore of the two firſt combinations, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his conciſeneſſe; and here where hee tooke a larger field, I was forced to doe the like.</p>
               <p>But why may ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, was hee ſo briefe in thoſe, and did ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large himſelfe in this?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the reaſon may bee threefold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the property of Pagan ſervants was to cozen and defraud their
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:1779:206"/> Maſters, and in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, like ſo many traitors, as <hi>Cato</hi> termed them, feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to curſe, and ſpeake evill both of their perſons, and proceedings.

                  </gap>. He thought him ſelfe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n hee could get but any opportunity to raile in ſecret upon his Maſter: and howſoever they to whom he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpake were converted to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, it was but newly yet, and any little diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment offered them by their Maſters, might have made them with the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ne to their vomit; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention whereof hee ſeekes by ſtrong enforcements
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:1779:206"/> to tie them to their dutie.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon may bee to expreſſe the riches of Gods mercy, who deſpiſeth not the very ſlave that is deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all; but ſeeks to make even him a lively ſtone for the building up of his moſt glorious <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe husbands are willing to enforme their Wives, parents carefull to teach their Children; whereas Maſters utterly negl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ct their Servants; God to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect, doth here afford them a large Volume of inſtructions.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon is for the comfort of ſervants, who by this preſſing of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may well reſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of Gods affection. The lover never thinkes his
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:1779:207"/> minde ſufficiently vented, and is therefore ſtill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Object of his love. And ſo it is here with God; hee doth dilate himſelfe in drawing them, to ſhew, that he doth much deſire them.</p>
               <p>A fourth and laſt reaſon may bee, the intimation of his owne humanity. The <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> when hee meets with a needy Patient, tels him in briefe, that Kitchin phyſick muſt bee his onely remedy. And ſo the <hi>Lawyer</hi> when hee lights upon a Thred-bare Client, to ſhake him off the ſooner, makes him beleeve his cauſe will not bee worth the triall. S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth them charity, venting his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and adviſe more freely, &amp; more fully in the behalfe
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:1779:207"/> of thoſe, whoſe inheritance in this world was nothing but the extremitie of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than hee had done for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that were of better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as if the ſaving of one of thoſe had beene a thing more meritorious than the other. And thus having apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logized for my tediouſneſſe in this point, I leave the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and come to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>

               <p>Againe, to comfort ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in their diſtreſſe a little farther; as hee ſhewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there tender over their ſoules, ſo doth he here over their Bodies. And becauſe
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:1779:211"/> it is an eaſie thing for any man to abuſe the power and authority which he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver another, and that there is not a more pernicious Creature, than a tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and cruell maſter, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits even their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings with his precepts; charging them to uſe thoſe that are under their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with Iuſtice and Equity. <hi>Yee maſters doe that which is</hi>—</p>
               <p>To come then to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelfe; it conſiſteth of two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Maſters muſt doe to their ſervants that which is juſt. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And in this is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whatſoever may be due to ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts by any legall Tie; or according to the poſitive Lawes, it excludes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:1779:212"/> may redound with hurt and prejudice unto them. It hath reference then both to their ſoules and Bodies. Maſters muſt doe that which is juſt to their Servants, in regard of their Soules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By uſing all poſſible meanes to helpe them unto Grace, as by training them up in the feare of God, by prayer, inſtruction, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both publike and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate wayes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Having by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and his owne induſtry brought them to ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this kinde, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a future relapſe, they muſt be very wary to chuſe ſuch for their aſſociates in the family as bee juſt. For if it be an injury to bring a
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:1779:212"/> Servant into the houſe, that hath either the Plague, or ſome other Contagious Ulcer running upon his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſhall appoint him to worke amongſt the reſt, whereby to endanger alſo them; It muſt bee an injury beyond compare, to bring in a lewd ſervant, that hath the Plague-ſoare of ſinne upon his ſoule. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſuch a one is farre more dangerous than the other.</p>
               <p>Now for their Bodies; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> propounds three things ſo neceſſary for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that they may bee accounted due; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and and that is the hyre, which
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:1779:213"/> is due to our ſervants, who are not ſlaves, like thoſe of former times. Now it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to the juſtice of the Maſter, to ſee, as occaſion ſhall bee offered, that all theſe things bee exhibited unto them in a due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and it is madneſſe in him to doe otherwiſe. For in impoſing his taskes, if hee tie them, as the Aegyptians did the Iſraelites to more, than they are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, they will ſoone grow faint and feeble; if to leſſe, ſluggiſh and idle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In giving them Food; if he detract and withhold that which is needfull and convenient, he pines them.</p>
               <p>Againe, if he feed them delicately, he makes them inſolent.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:1779:213"/>3. In uſing correction; if he be too outragious, &amp; wil puniſh them beyond the quality of the fault; he may kill their bodies; Againe, if he be too remiſſe, and will ſuffer them, whatſoever they commit, to paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſured, hee deſtroyes their very ſoules.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the allowance of their wages, hee that is too pinching may diſhearten them from doing well; and againe, hee that is too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall, may the more inable them to doe ill. So that in every one of theſe there is a meane required, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may doe unto their ſervants, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That which is iuſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Then that he may not erre in the firſt; let him
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:1779:214"/> know, that every man is not a <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to manage himſelfe alone the buſineſſe of a whole Family; Even <hi>Moſes</hi> when the burden is too great, muſt have a <hi>Iethro</hi> helpe him to ſupport it. Let him therefore put a hand unto the Plough himſelfe; and as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes,<note place="margin">Pro. 27.23.</note> let him bee diligent to know the ſtate of his owne flocke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As touching the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; He that pampereth his Horſe ſhall finde him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtife, when hee would uſe him; ſo he that travails him, and will not feed him, ſhall bee forced for the ending of his journey to make a Hackney of his owne leggs. Let him provide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a portion, and give
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:1779:214"/> them their Ordinary in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To avoid the third; Let him winke at ſlight faults; and for ſuch as are groſſe and palpable, let him puniſh them as <hi>Plato</hi> did, by Deputie; or if he will needs doe it of himſelfe, let him ſtay till the violence of his paſſion be allayed, that he may doe it with inſtruction, and moderation, and in ſuch a manner as may bee profitable to them, and his whole Family.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, that hee may not prove unjuſt in the fourth, hee muſt allow them ſuch a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of wages for their worke, that they may not onely bee able to furniſh themſelves with things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:1779:215"/> for the preſent; but have alſo ſome remnant in ſtore for the future. It was <hi>Iacobs</hi> diligence, which looked for this; and it was <hi>Labans</hi> duty to afford it; <hi>Chi ben ſerve, aſſai dimanda,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Italian Adage.</hi> And thus much for the firſt particular. <hi>Maſters doe that which is iuſt.</hi>

               <p>The ſecond followes, <hi>And equall to your ſervants;</hi>

                  </gap> therefore doth not denote unto us the workes and offices of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Maſters; which are indeed ſo differing, that they are plainely oppoſite; but it is referred to the minde, and manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which in a kinde of an analogicall proportion ſhould bee the like in both. As for example; the proper office of a ſervant is to <hi>obey,</hi> that of a Maſter to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi> Now theſe in no wiſe muſt be changed, for they be particular kindes of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and diverſly appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; but to doe that which we doe in <hi>ſingleneſſe of heart,</hi> and with all alacrity and chearefulneſſe, as ſervants unto Chriſt; theſe are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:1779:216"/> equally common unto both. And in this look how the Maſter would have his ſervants demeane them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards him; ſo muſt he demean himſelf towards his ſervant.

                  </gap>, this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie,</hi> which is here injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Briefly then to epitomize the difference, which is betwixt theſe termes. That may bee ſaid here in this

               <p n="1">1. To account of his Servant, as one made of the ſame mould, and partaker of the ſame grace with him ſelfe.

This conſidered, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon</hi> commands him to receive <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> being converted to the Faith, <hi>No more as a ſervant, but above a ſervant, even as a brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this we may finde matter of comfort for Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:1779:217"/> and againe matter of Humiliation and Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Superiours. For the Servant is Chriſts <hi>free-man;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> and the Maſter is Chriſts ſervant. Let then the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of low degree rejoyce in this, <hi>That hee is exalted in Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 1.</note> to be equall with the greateſt Prince that ever ſway'd a Scepter in the World; yea to bee farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him, if hee bee out of Chriſt. Againe, according to Saint <hi>Iames</hi> adviſe in the ſame place; Let the Brother of high degree rejoyce in his Humility; even in this, That in Chriſt, hee maketh equall with himſelfe the meaneſt. Let him not glory in any outward prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency hee hath over them; but let his reioycing bee,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:1779:218"/> that ſuch a poore and ſilly Beggar is his Fellow. And ſure this can be no diſgrace, or ſhame to any. For if God acknowledge them to be his ſonnes, what diſparagement can it bee to us, if wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them for our Brethren? Nay, it is a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſhewes, a matter to be boaſted in; for if they be our <hi>Brethren,</hi> then is God our <hi>Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let no man therefore of what ranke or calling ſoever hee bee, feare to admit the pooreſt Chriſtian for his Brother, though hee were his owne bondſlave, but let him do unto him, <hi>That which is iuſt and equall.</hi> Let not the pride of his heart ſo puffe him up in regard of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition in the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:1779:218"/> world, as to make him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his Inferiour, and ſo to carry himſelfe towards him, as if he were not his Brother of the ſame Crhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion, and of the ſame precious faith with himſelfe. And that he may the better doe this, let him champe a little upon the various changes and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereunto all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affaires are lyable. <hi>Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis accidere poteſt, quod cuipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am poteſt,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Mimik.</hi> Whatſoever wee ſee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to any man, may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto us. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was free borne, and yet became a ſlave.

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:1779:219"/> and Authority which they have over their Inferiours. My meaning onely is, That no inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in their civill Calling, ſhould make them forget the equality in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. We muſt ſo temper our carriage, that as our equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in Chriſt may not make us forget our inequalitie in the world; ſo on the other ſide, our inequalitie in the world, ſhould not make us forget our Equalitie in Chriſt. <hi>Maſters muſt doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſervants that which is iuſt and equall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond operation of this <hi>Equalitie,</hi> is ſo to deale with our ſervants in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, as when Reaſon ſhall require it, to give way unto them.<note place="margin">Eſa. 40.</note> God is abſolute

               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:1779:220"/>
               <p>The third is out of a due conſideration of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, mercifully and gently to entreate our Servants, and with all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity and love to cheriſh them, when eyther age, ſickneſſe, or any other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity ſhall have enfeebled their ſtrength, and made them altogether unable for imployments. And for this very cauſe it ſeemes to me, that a Maſter was called by the ancient Romans <hi>Pater-familias,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Macrob. Saturn. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> The Father of the family, becauſe with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly tenderneſſe hee was to looke to all thoſe of the houſhold, as being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his truſt, and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. The Centurion ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe to bee truly
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:1779:221"/> ſuch a one: Firſt, In that he tooke the paines to come himſelfe unto Chriſt for the recovery of his diſeaſed Servant. Secondly, In that he counted him as a child; <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>my Child lyeth ſicke at home of a palſie,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The fourth is, with a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Eye to weigh the merits of a faythfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and to give him out of courſe, and above his compoſition, ſome kinde remuneration. For when a Servant in his love and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity toward his Maſter ſhall have ſhewne himſelfe more than a Servant, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality requireth that the Maſter in his liberality,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:1779:221"/> and bounty towards him, ſhould ſhew himſelfe more than a Maſter. <hi>Servus ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tus ſittibi dilectus quaſi anima,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe man. Love an underſtanding Servant, as thou wouldſt thine own Soule; defraud him not of liberty, neyther leave him a poore man. In this hee ſhould not ſo much regard, what law, and humane cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome may require, as what Charity, and Chriſtian meekneſſe doth injoyne. For if he performe not thoſe, he ſhall be counted uniuſt, even before the Tribunall of men; but if he doe not theſe he ſhall be arraigned, and condemned of wickedneſſe and cruelty before the Iudgment-ſeate
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:1779:222"/> of God. There muſt be an equall, and analogicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding amongſt all ſorts of men; and whatſoever ſuperiours doe at any time exact from thoſe that are under them, they muſt be very carefull to returne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the like,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.9.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the very ſame; <hi>Si non ſpecie tamen analogia;</hi> if not in kind, yet in proportion. For this is that, which is here commanded: <hi>Maſters doe that which is iuſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall unto your ſervants.</hi> And thus much of the Precept. The motive alleaged by the Apoſtle for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this precept is the point that followeth. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that yee alſo have a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>—</p>
               <pb n="443" facs="tcp:1779:222"/>
               <p>Now this is twofold. For firſt, they muſt know that themſelves alſo have a Maſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary maſter, but a Maſter in Heaven.</p>
               <p>As touching the firſt. The onely thing which moveth many to be injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their Servants is a high conceit of their owne abſolute power: They thinke themſelves Lords Paramont; and altogether free from the checke of any; hence is it, that often times they break forth into bitter outrages, and when a thing is not inſtantly done according to their minde, as if there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and their Dog, they
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:1779:223"/> care not with what fury they aſſault him. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle therefore to bridle this intemperancy, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a fruite of our arrogant inſulting fleſh, would have them know, and remember, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are alſo Servants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of one, and the ſame Lord, and ſo conſequently, fellow-ſervants with their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Now 'tis altogether diſſonant from reaſon, that a ſervant, though he be of higher ranke, and more honourable place ſhould deale unjuſtly, and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally with his fellowes. For it is an Axiome with God in the government of his houſhold, what meaſure wee mete to others, the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:1779:223"/> ſame ſhall be meted unto us againe. We may ſee it exemplified in the Goſpell. He that had ten thouſand Talents remitted him,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.32.</note> and yet was mercileſſe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting an hundred pence, <hi>O thou evill ſervant,</hi> ſaid the Lord unto him, <hi>I forgave thee all thy debt, becauſe thou prayedſt me; And oughteſt not thou alſo to have had pity upon thy fellow-ſervant, even as I had pity on thee? So the Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the Tormentors, till hee ſhould pay all that was due unto him.</hi> It behoveth therefore god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and religious Maſters, ſo to thinke of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as to know them for more than ſervants; And againe, ſo to conceit of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:1779:224"/> themſelves, as to know that they are leſſe than Maſters, even fellow-labourers with their Servants in the worke of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Worldly Greatneſſe doth uſually forget her owne ſubordination to a higher power; and is by reaſon of this ſo puffed up, with inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, that in her carriage towards others ſhe heeds nor Iuſtice, nor equality; we have it inſtanced in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> came unto him with a meſſage from the Lord ſaving; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael; Let my people go, that they may celebrate a feaſt unto me in the wilderneſſe:</hi> And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould heare his voice and let
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:1779:224"/> Iſrael goe? I know not the Lord, neyther will I let Iſrael goe:</hi> But what event had this his ſupercilious pride? Did it not bring a miſerable ruine and deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ation upon his whole Kingdome? Maſters then, doe that, which is Iuſt and equall to your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants knowing that ye alſo have a Maſter, who can, and will exact from you a ſtrict account of your whole carriage and proceedings, even towards them. For as it followes in the ſecond place; <hi>He is a Heavenly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is; one, who is Iuſt, omnipotent, omniſcient, and to ſhut up all in a word, God himſelfe. And this is a ſpeciall conſideration
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:1779:225"/> whereby to reſtraine the cruelty of Maſters towards their Servants. For what is the reaſon, that Maſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently towards their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but becauſe they ſee them altogether deſtitute of any power or faculty to withſtand their violence; and are withall perſwaded, that there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s no Iudge that will enlarge himſelfe ſo farre in their behalfe, as to take upon him the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their wrongs? The Apoſtle therefore to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this conceit, will have Maſters to know, that is, aſſuredly to hold, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that they alſo have a maſter, and ſuch a one, as is not mortall; but celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:1779:225"/> and will not ſuffer them to goe unpuniſhed, if in any ſort they abuſe that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which by delegation they have received from him over their Servants. Being ſubject to ſuch a maſter they ought with all holy reſpect to obſerve in every thing, this Iuſtice, and equality, which is here preſcribed</p>
               <p>For firſt, this heavenly maſter is omniſcient: and there is no wicked or unjuſt act can be ſo cloſely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as to lie concealed from his knowledge. His eyes are ten thouſand times brighter than the Sun, and there is nothing in Heaven, in Earth, or in the deepe, which he doth not ſee, yea
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:1779:226"/> though it were hid, I ſay not within the Reines and Hearts of our Bodies, but in the Reines and Heart of the loweſt deſtruction. <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia coram illo nuda</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>All things are naked before him.</hi> Tis more than ſhameleſſe impudency ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the fight of ſuch a maſter to entreate our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes cruelly and proter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly. For even the worſt kind of ſervants will be ſure to afford <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that ſame eye-ſervice, which was ſpoken of before. And he of whom we read in the Goſpell, never went about to moleſt or afflict the reſt of the houſhold, till hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:1779:226"/> removed from his ſight; but this heavenly Maſter hath his eye evermore upon us; and therefore wee can at no time ſafely domineere in an imperious manner, and beyond all Iuſtice, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie, over thoſe that are under our government and iuriſdiction.</p>
